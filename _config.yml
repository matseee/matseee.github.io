# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values

# feature for the data you need to update frequently.

# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  hello i'm Matthias, a software development enthusiast since the age of 13. 
  Since 2017 I'm working in a German software company as a software engineer. In my tech stack I mainly deal with SAP, SAP UI5 and Angular.
  Here you can find some stuff about technology (most likely programming and 3d printing).
  
  
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
